    <h1>Noah Johnson</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hello! My name is Noah Johnson, and I'm currently embarking on my freshman journey at Youngstown State University. As a passionate computer science major, I find myself constantly intrigued by the ever-evolving world of technology. Beyond the screen, you'll often find me hitting the pavement, indulging in my love for running, a passion I've nurtured for the past six years through both cross country and track and field. When I'm not absorbed in coding or logging miles, I thrive on exploring new horizons. Whether it's jetting off to unfamiliar destinations, cheering on my favorite baseball team, catching the latest flick at the movies, trekking through nature's wonders, or enjoying leisurely bike rides alongside my wonderful girlfriend Mya, I relish every moment of adventure life throws my way.</p>
